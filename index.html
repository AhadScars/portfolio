                    <h3>Project 1 - Task Management App</h3>
                    <p>A basic task management system built with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, where users can create, update, and delete tasks. <a href="https://github.com/AhadScars/taskApi	">View Project</a></p>
                </div>
<div class="project">
                    <h3>Project 2 - Blogger Application (Spring Boot-based Blogging Platform)</h3>
			 <p>This project is a simple and secure Blog API developed using Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL (PgAdmin). It provides functionality for users to create, manage, and organize blog posts while implementing essential features such as user authentication, role-based access, and category management. The API supports JWT authentication for secure login and registration, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain endpoints. Additionally, the system is equipped with role-based access control (Admin & User), allowing for different levels of permissions. Users can easily create, update, and delete blog posts, with robust pagination and sorting mechanisms in place for managing large volumes of posts. The integration of PostgreSQL and PgAdmin ensures a reliable and scalable database solution, while Maven handles the build process for smooth project management. With these features, this Blog API offers a complete, secure, and efficient solution for building and managing a blog platform.<a href="https://github.com/AhadScars/blogApi">View Project</a></p>

                    <h3>Project 3 - Hospital Managment</h3>
                    <p>A Spring Boot-based Hospital Management System that simplifies the management of patient appointments, doctor schedules, and hospital operations. This application provides a centralized platform for managing various aspects of healthcare services, including appointment scheduling, doctor-patient interactions, and hospital information.<a href="https://github.com/AhadScars/HospitalManagment/tree/master">View Project</a></p>

                    <h3>Project 4 - E-Commerce</h3>
                    <p>This E-commerce API allows admin and user roles, with different levels of access to product management and shopping functionalities. Admin users have full control over the product catalog, including the ability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) product details such as description, price, and other attributes. On the other hand, regular users can browse the available products, view their details, and add them to their cart for later checkout. The API ensures secure authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), allowing for safe and token-based access to all endpoints. Admins can manage the products, while users can easily interact with the product catalog, add items to their cart, and proceed with their purchases—all while ensuring the system's security and scalability.<a href="https://github.com/AhadScars/E-Commerce">View Project</a></p>
